# E-Commerce-Back-end-ORM

## Description
 Built the back end for an e-commerce site. Used Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## Usage
This application is invoked by using the following command: node server.js

The user will need to install the following dependencies: npm, express, mysql2, and sequelize. 

Insomnia Core is used to test the routes.
